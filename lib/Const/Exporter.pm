Const::Exporter - Declare constants for export.

=begin readme

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

This module requires Perl v5.10 or newer, and the following non-core
modules:

=over

=item L<Const::Fast>

=item L<Hash::Objectify> (for testing)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Define a constants module:

  package MyApp::Constants;

  use Const::Fast;

  our $zoo => 1234;

  use Const::Exporter

     tag_a => [                  # use MyApp::Constants /:tag_a/;
        'foo'  => 1,             # exports "foo"
        '$bar' => 2,             # exports "$bar"
        '@baz' => [qw/ a b c /], # exports "@baz"
        '%bo'  => { a => 1 },    # exports "%bo"
     ],

     tag_b => [                  # use MyApp::Constants /:tag_b/;
        'foo',                   # exports "foo" (same as from ":tag_a")
        '$zoo',                  # exports "$zoo" (as defined above)
     ];

  # `use Const::Exporter` can be specified multiple times

  use Const::Exporter

     tag_b => [                 # we can add symbols to ":tab_b"
        'moo' => $bar,          # exports "moo" (same value as "$bar")
     ],

     enums => [

       [qw/ goo gab gub /] => 0, # exports enumerated symbols, from 0..2

     ],

     default => [qw/ fo $bar /]; # exported by default

and use that module:

  package MyApp;

  use MyApp::Constants qw/ $zoo :tag_a /;

  ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module allows you to declare constants that can be exported to
other modules.

=for readme stop

To declare constants, simply group then into export tags:

  package MyApp::Constants;

  use Const::Exporter

    tag_a => [
       'foo' => 1,
       'bar' => 2,
    ],

    tag_b => [
       'baz' => 3,
       'bar',
    ],

    default => [
       'foo',
    ];

Constants in the C<default> tag are exported by default (that is, they
are added to the C<@EXPORTS> array).

When a constant is already defined in a previous tag, then no value is
specified for it. (For example, C<bar> in C<tab_b> above.)  If you do
give a value, L<Const::Exporter> will assume it's another symbol.

Your module can include multiple calls to C<use Const::Exporter>, so
that you can reference constants in other expressions, e.g.

  use Const::Exporter

    tag => [
        '$zero' => 0,
    ];

  use Const::Exporter

    tag => [
        '$one' => 1 + $zero,
    ];

or even something more complex:

  use Const::Exporter

     http_ports => [
        'HTTP'     => 80,
        'HTTP_ALT' => 8080,
        'HTTPS'    => 443,
     ];

  use Const::Exporter

     http_ports => [
        '@HTTP_PORTS' => [ HTTP, HTTP_ALT, HTTPS ],
     ];

Constants can include traditional L<constant> symbols, as well as
scalars, arrays or hashes.

Constants can include values defined elsewhere in the code, e.g.

  our $foo;

  BEGIN {
     $foo = calculate_value_for_constant();
  }

  use Const::Exporter

    tag => [ '$foo' ];

Note that this will make the symbol read-only. You don't need to
explicitly declare it as such.

Enumerated constants are also supported:

  use Const::Exporter

    tag => [

      [qw/ foo bar baz /] => 1,

    ];

will define the symbols C<foo> (1), C<bar> (2) and C<baz> (3).

You can also specify a list of numbers, if you want to skip values:

  use Const::Exporter

    tag => [

      [qw/ foo bar baz /] => [1, 4],

    ];

will define the symbols C<foo> (1), C<bar> (4) and C<baz> (5).

You can even specify string values:

  use Const::Exporter

    tag => [

      [qw/ foo bar baz /] => [qw/ feh meh neh /],

    ];

however, this is equivalent to

  use Const::Exporter

    tag => [
      'foo' => 'feh',
      'bar' => 'meh',
      'baz' => 'neh',
    ];

Objects are also supported,

   use Const::Exporter

    tag => [
      '$foo' => Something->new( 123 ),
    ];

=head2 Mixing POD with Tags

The following code is a syntax error, at least with some versions of
Perl:

  use Const::Exporter

  =head2 a

  =cut

    a => [ foo => 1 ],

  =head2 b

  =cut

    b => [ bar => 2 ];

If you want to mix POD with your declarations, use multiple use lines,
e.g.

  =head2 a

  =cut

  use Const::Exporter
    a => [ foo => 1 ];

  =head2 b

  =cut

  use Const::Exporter
    b => [ bar => 2 ];

=head2 Export Tags

By default, all symbols are exportable (in C<@EXPORT_OK>.)

The C<:default> tag is the same as not specifying any exports.

The C<:all> tag exports all symbols.

=head2 Using as part of a module with exported functions

L<Const::Exporter> is not intended for use with modules that also
export functions.

There are workarounds that you can use, such as getting
L<Const::Exporter> to export your functions, or munging C<@EXPORT>
etc. separately, but these are not supported and changes in the
future my break our code.

=for readme continue

=head1 SEE ALSO

See L<Exporter> for a discussion of export tags.

=head2 Similar Modules

=over

=item L<Exporter::Constants>

This module only allows you to declare function symbol constants, akin
to the L<constant> module, without tags.

=item L<Constant::Exporter>

This module only allows you to declare function symbol constants, akin
to the L<constant> module, although you can specify tags.

=item L<Constant::Export::Lazy>

This module only allows you to declare function symbol constants, akin
to the L<constant> module by defining functions that are only called
as needed.  The interface is rather complex.
